# Example-Society-as-an-Open-Source-Project
Designing a city through an open source github project. Example with information from Notes on the Synthesis of Form by Christopher Alexander "The Determination of Components for an Indian Village" and information from Praxis. Direct words used from both.

NOTES:
Proposals (infra build, policy change, budget allocation, etc.)

Facilitating, measuring, and open sourcing contribution to development of a society.

Goal is accelerating technological progress to create a vital future for humanity

Designing the space and rules to enable development of culture and economy, driving technological progress. Rules enabling experiments, permitting free exchange, encouring a culture of risk taking.

Government largely controls space and right to make rules. Government benefits from new city developments by driving economic growth. Economic and cultural capital from residents and companies need to be measureable and must form financial capital. 

Captial coordination (human, cultural, financial) and speed of physical construction are bottlenecks. 

Technology to unlock coordination and construction efficiencies to 100x growth rate. Past examples from industrial age were new communication and finnancial technologies (eg. telegraphs and telephones; the growth of joint-stock companies and stock exhanges) as well as mass manufacturing.

Internet and crypto as new tech for human and fiancial capital coordination. The internet has enabled people across the globe to connect around common interests and rapidly scale social movements. Crypto unlocks new ways to pool reources to fund them.

Tools to coordinate groups 10x the scale of industrial cities 10x faster towards common ends and to coalesce the capital to fund new cities' development. 

The Network State

Collaborating with governments.

Team including former heads of state, veteran city builders (developed 3 US cities >100k residents) and learned precisely what is needed to get rule changes that unlock technological progress in areas including energy (nuclear), AI, crypto, manufacturing, and more. Negotiated initial terms with governments.

Finalize meaningful rule changes by (1) demonstrating the economic and cultural capital of our community and (2) coalesce financial capital on that basis. 

Most talented people in the world - founders, engineers, researchers, artists - based in 69 countries and 268 cities. Thousands have committed deposits towards moving. Somewhat disorganized, and far from realizing the potential energy of our Residents. 

WE NEED A SIMPLE MECHANISM THAT REVEALS THE LATENT ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL CAPITAL OF OUR COMMUNITY, AMPLIFIES EXISTING ZEAL, AND MAXIMIZES IT IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRAXIS. 

PRAX is a measure of a stakeholder's contribution to the development of Praxis, calculated on the basis of the quality of attempt and completion of specified actions target at furthering the project. The revealed economic and cultural captial will convey to capital markets the scale and quality of demand for PRaxis unlocking the scalable financial commitments needed to unlock rule changes from Host Governments

Proven demand unlocks capital; capital unlocks rule changes that accellerate tech progress

You earn PRAX by doing Commits. Commits are specified actions that contribute to dthe development of Praxis: the movement, the city, and (eventually) the network. Commits demonstrate and growt the economic and cultural capital of Praxis. 
You also earn PRAX by referring citizens and companies that apply to the Steel Visa and BOP. If successful, you earn PRAX

Initially, only stakeholders (Residents, BOPs, and applicants to both) are eligible. You can apply to become eligible.

    Building the Economy and Culture of Praxis:
        Building businesses on/in Praxis
        Construction in Praxis
        Moving to Praxis
        Building the movement

GEOHOTZ TWITTER
Open source the firmware_docs and remove the signature check. We'd treat it like bring up for our own chip, get builds, testing fuzzing etc.
Twitter announcements about bounties claimed:  The first $600 MLPerf training bounty has been claimed for ResNet-50. Two are locked, but three are still open for anyone! Must train a qualifying model in < 24 hours. When you are ready for a run, we will get you access to a tinybox.

Pull requests over emailed resumes. New grad or lateral talen who works hard and really contributes well could get a job by just actually doing the job directly. No interview, plenty of bounties.

Employee is on a spectrum. If you have motivation and skills, you can start from anywhere. This is the future of hiring. 

If AMD open sources their firmware, I'll fix their LLVM spilling bug and write a fuzzer for HSA. Otherwise, it's not worth putting tons of effort into fixing bugs on a platform you don't own.

The gatekeeping I propose is simple.
* What port is DNS on?
* What's the complexity of sort?
* Name an x86 register.
If people can't answer these sorts of questions, you shouldn't work with them and they shouldn't be in tech.

Build technology that doesn't depend on Industrial Society. Have it irrevocably give the individual power and new abilities. 
It is only through the advancement of this technology that we will be able to return to nature.

Played with @tenstorrent
 accelerator yesterday. They are raising the bar for open source.

While @AMD
 is a lot more open than @nvidia
, they still have a closed scheduler and cmd parser. TT is open and modifiable.
This is how you will win this space.
https://github.com/tenstorrent-me

thanks @realGeorgeHotz
 
you said open source the software
    it took some work
you said work on it in the open, we mostly are
    a few more bits to untangle
expect updates, bumps and performance regularly

Competitors
People who have done well at math competitions (USAMO, IMO, PUTNAM), competition programming (ACM, USACO, codejam, topcoder), science fairs (ISEF, STS), or capture the flag (DEFCON, secuinside, GITS).

Competitions don't just select for ability, they also select for quickness. We are in a very competitive space.
Contributors
People who have contributed value to open source projects.

Show us your github. Got stars? Code is never measured in quantity, but rather quality.

We value those who can do more with less code; software engineering doesn't have an external selection pressure for low part count and cost like EE and ME, but you pay massive costs down the line in debugging and upkeep.
Architects
People who can design good APIs and source layouts on the first try. This is crucial to working in teams and scaling.

Before you do work, you should be able to explain to a contractor what you want done. ME has a great divide between design and machining that software lacks; we want to try to fix that.
Great, email your resume and GitHub to us: work at comma.ai. If you include a good solution to our programming challenge in your e-mail, we'll take you much more seriously.After a programming challenge, we'll do a phone screen, and if that goes well, we will bring you out for a microinternship, where you'll meet the team and work on a real problem in our real codebase for a few days.
Since it’s your first day, let’s get you onboarded.

    Fork openpilot on GitHub. This is where all development happens and where you’ll push your code.
    Join the community Discord. Along with GitHub, this is where openpilot developers coordinate and discuss development.
    Set up your development environment. openpilot is designed to run on a smartphone processor, so any PC will do.
    Play the openpilot CTF to learn the tools.

Since early 2020, openpilot has been built entirely in public by comma and users like you. And today, I’m excited to announce the openpilot bounty system. These days, there’s little difference between an “internal” and “external” workflow. We all use the same tools to develop openpilot and work towards the same mission, and the bounties further blur the line between contributor and comma employee.

There’s a continuous spectrum from external contributor all the way to full time openpilot engineer:

    Want your car to be supported? Port it, upstream it for everyone to use, and get a discount on your comma 3X.
    Frequent contributors and fork maintainers will make more than enough to cover all their comma hardware needs.
    Want a remote job? We don’t offer those, but you can solve as many bounties as you want!

Want a Job?Permalink

A job is for contributors consistently solving bounties with high quality work. We’re mostly looking for software engineers who can independently improve openpilot while reducing complexity. These are some roles good software engineers can fill:

Full Stack Engineer: You’ll own comma connect and comma prime. A comma 3X paired with openpilot has all the hardware and logging infrastructure to be one of the best dashcams around. We just need to make a nice app around it, with features like sentry mode.

Car Interface Engineer: A software engineer that’s familiar with automotive safety standards such as ISO 26262. You’ll work on things like comma AEB.

Production Engineer: A software engineer with hardware knowledge that writes software to run and manage the comma factory. Do you know all the parts in a cell phone?

Interns: Interns are welcome year-round to work on all parts of the openpilot stack: car hacking, production, OS/systems, full stack, etc.
How do I apply?Permalink

Choose a bounty, solve it, and repeat. That’s it! No resume polishing or coding on a whiteboard. Once you’ve solved a few, reach out to givemeajob@comma.ai.

Rules

    code must be merged into openpilot master
    bounty eligibility is solely at our discretion
    once you open a PR, the bounty is locked to you until you stop working on it
    open a ticket at comma.ai/support with links to your PRs to claim
    get an extra 20% if you redeem your bounty in comma shop credit (including refunds on previous orders)

We put up each bounty with the intention that it'll get merged, but occasionally the right resolution is to close the bounty, which only becomes clear once some effort is put in. This is still valuable work, so we'll pay out $100 for getting any bounty closed with a good explanation.
Issue bounties

We've tagged bounty-eligible issues across openpilot and the rest of our repos; check out all the open ones here. These bounties roughly work out like this:

    $100 - a few hours of work for an experienced openpilot developer; a good intro for someone new to openpilot
    $300 - a day of work for an experienced openpilot developer
    $500 - a few days of work for an experienced openpilot developer
    $1k+ - a week or two of work (could be less for the right person)

New bounties can be proposed in the #contributing channel in Discord.
Car bounties

The car bounties only apply to cars that have a path to ship in openpilot release, which excludes unsupportable cars (e.g. Fords with a steering lockout) or cars that require extra hardware (Honda Accord with serial steering).
Brand or platform port - $2000

Example PR: commaai/openpilot#23331

This is for adding support for an entirely new brand or a substantially new ADAS platform within a brand (e.g. the Volkswagen PQ platform).
Model port - $250

Example PR: commaai/openpilot#30245

This is for porting a new car model that runs on a platform openpilot already supports. In the average case, this is a few hours of work for an experienced software developer.

This bounty also covers getting openpilot supported on a previously unsupported trim of an already supported car, e.g. the Chevy Bolt without ACC.
Reverse Engineering a new Actuation Message - $300

This is for cars that are already supported, and it has three components:

    reverse a new steering, adaptive cruise, or AEB message
    merge the DBC definitions to opendbc
    merge the openpilot code to use it and post a demo route

The control doesn't have to be perfect, but it should generally do what it's supposed to do.
Specific Cars
Rivian R1T or R1S - $3000

Get a Rivian driving with openpilot. Requires a merged port with lateral control and at least a POC of longitudinal control.
Toyota SecOc - $5000

We're contributing $5k to the community-organized bounty.
Chevy Bolt with SuperCruise - $2500
The Bolt is already supported on the trim with standard ACC. Get openpilot working on the trim with SuperCruise. It must be a normal install: no extra pandas or other hardware, no ECU reflashes, etc. The full bounty is for a port with lateral and longitudinal control. $1500 of the bounty can be claimed with a lateral-only port.

Posting salary ranges since a few people asked.

Interns get $1400-$2000 / week depending on experience.

Full time at this stage gets 80k-120k and 0.5%-2% of the company.

All interns must do bounties first. All full time must be interns first.

For reference, startup equity is usually a scam, but this is only because many startup founders are scammers.

comma employees in the last couple years have sold equity for $300M-$600M.

I expect tiny will have even faster revenue growth.

Three step guide to getting a full time job (if you want one, you can do bounties / propose bounties for as long as you want)
https://twitter.com/__tinygrad__/status/1732448088604950598
1. Do bounties (for a couple weeks)
1.5. Promotion to "proposer." Propose your own bounties, have them approved, and do them (we pay obviously), show you can think as the company (for a couple weeks)
2. Intern
3. Full time

$100 bounties are a few line change and could be 10 minutes if you see it
$200 bounties are a couple hours to a day of work and are mostly standalone
$500 bounties are a couple days of work and require a few prereqs
$1000 bounties require some refactoring to core tinygrad
$1000+ bounties require planning and thought and likely a solid week+ of work. you probably should have done other bounties first. i'm happy to give feedback on serious proposals

Remember, tinygrad is an open source project and belongs to us all. It's MIT licensed. I'm just fortunate enough to have some funding to move it along faster.
If you would like to sponsor a new bounty, e-mail george@tinygrad.org. Please include a clear description and a dollar amount.

Hotz offered to join Twitter on November 16th after voicing support for CEO Elon Musk’s proclamation that the company would need to be “extremely hardcore.” “This is the attitude that builds incredible things,” Hotz, who resigned as CEO of self-driving startup Comma AI in October, said on Twitter. “Let all the people who don’t desire greatness leave.” In response to a tweet mocking him, Hotz said he would “put my money where my mouth is” with a 12-week internship at Twitter in San Francisco. Musk replied “let’s talk.”

Two days later, on November 18th, Hotz said he was officially working for Twitter. Three days after that, Hotz said Musk had tasked him with two things and that he indeed had 12 weeks to finish them: fixing Twitter search and fixing the popup you might see if you scroll Twitter while not logged in.

you can use GitHub to follow along, collaborate with your team, track your work, and share information

Repositories contain issues, discussions, and pull requests (more on that in a moment), as well as “code”, which for non-technical roles, is often text files in the form of Markdown (more on that too).

Issues are how work is tracked on GitHub. You can think of them as “To Do” items (or “tickets” in some contexts). Issues describe the problems you or your team want to solve, with the list of potential problems being referred to as team’s “issue backlog”. You can comment on issues, like you would a blog post, assign them to people, and close them when they have been completed. Issues can also be labeled for ease of discoverability and for tracking additional metadata. For especially complex problems, the body of the issue can even include a task list with checkboxes, to track progress of individual sub-tasks.

Discussions

Discussions are like issues, but don’t have a specific outcome or sense of state (open or closed). You can use discussions to ask questions, collaborate on ideas, and share announcements. You can think of discussions like blog posts, an online forum, or a chat room for your repository.

Pull requests

Pull requests are how you propose changes to a repository. If issues describe the problems, pull requests describe the proposed solutions. Others can also review your proposed changes and comment on, make suggested changes to, or “approve” your pull request. Pull requests modify files within the repository. Once approved, your pull requested is “merged” into the repository and your proposed changes are “live”.

Tracking changes

At the core of GitHub is a version control system called Git. Git tracks changes to files over time. You can think of it like tracked changes in Google Docs or Microsoft Word (or if you’re into Sci Fi, a time machine for your files). You can see who made changes, when they were made, and what the changes were. You can also “roll back” changes to a previous version of a file.

Commits

Git tracks changes as “commits”. A commit is a snapshot of the file (or files) at a point in time. Each commit should have a brief, descriptive message describing the changes from the previous version, to help you and your colleagues understand what’s going on.

Branches

Branches are like parallel universes or alternate timelines for your files. You can make changes to a branch without affecting files on the “main” branch. Branches contain one or more commits, and when you’re ready, you can merge your changes (commits) into the main branch to update the files there. You can think of branches as saving a copy of a file so that you can work on changes without affecting others’ work, but in a way that makes it easier to merge any changes you make back in with the original when you’re ready.

GitHub flow

GitHub flow describes the process of making changes to a repository. The basic steps are:

    Open an issue describing the problem you want to solve
    Once there is agreement that the problem should be solved, decide on the best solution
    Create a branch to work on the solution
    Make changes to files on the branch
    Commit those changes
    Open a pull request “requesting” that those changes be merged back into the “main” branch
    Your colleagues review your pull request and either approve them or suggest changes
    Once approved, your pull request is “merged” and your changes are now “live” on the main branch

Another powerful GitHub feature is issue and pull request cross references. You can reference another issue or pull request in a comment by including its number (for example, This is related to #123). When cross referenced, links are created between the two issues or pull requests, making it easier for others to discover and understand the context of the conversation.

Finding information

With so much information available on GitHub, it’s often intimidating to find what you’re looking for. Here are some tips for using GitHub’s powerful search to find anything on GitHub:

    Use keyword search, just like you would any search engine. For example, searching for widgets will find all repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions that contain the word “widgets”.
    Scope your search to an organization or repository by using the org: or repo: qualifiers. For example, org:github will find all issues in all repositories in the github organization, or repo:github/docs will find all issues in the github/docs repository.
    You can further refine your search to only show threads that you’re involved in by using the involves:@me modifier. For example, widgets involves:@me will find all issues, pull requests, and discussions that contain the word “widgets” and that you are involved in.
    Different types of information (issues, pull requests, discussions, Markdown) are displayed as separate results. Be sure to check the side bar to see all the different types of information that match your search.
    You can limit a “code” search to only Markdown files, by clicking “Markdown” in the sidebar to filter results, or adding language:Markdown to your search query.

    When to use an issue vs. a pull request vs. a discussion vs. a Markdown file vs. a project board

Project work generally flows in this order:

    Discussions - Opened-ended conversation without a specific outcome or concept of “done”. This is often the ideation or brainstorming stage.
    Issues - How problems are tracked, discussed, and prioritized.
    Pull requests - How solutions/changes are proposed and reviewed. Generally pull requests should tie back to the issue/problem they are solving.
    Markdown files - How long-lived information is shared and stored (documentation, policy, procedures, etc.). Markdown files are changed via pull request.

As a project proceeds in one or more repositories, high-level project progress is tracked on one or more project boards (which visually organizes the state of multiple issues).
Putting it all together, editing a file on the web

    Open the repository you want to edit
    Navigate to the file you want to edit
    Click the pencil icon to edit the file
    Make your changes
    Click “Commit changes” to save your changes
    Describe your changes in the commit message
    Name your branch
    Click “Propose changes” to open a pull request
    Describe your changes in the pull request, ideally referencing the issue you’re solving (for example, Closes #123)
    Your colleagues review your pull request and either approve them or suggest changes
    Once approved and checks pass, your pull request is “merged” and your changes are now “live” on the main branch
    Celebrate your first contribution to GitHub!
