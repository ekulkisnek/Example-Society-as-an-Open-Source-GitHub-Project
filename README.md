# Example-Society-as-an-Open-Source-Project
Designing a society through an open source GitHub project. Example with component files created from Notes on the Synthesis of Form by Christopher Alexander "The Determination of Components for an Indian Village" and issues created with information from Praxis. Direct words used from both. Open source and bounty approach inspired by/copied @geohot.

Why an open source GitHub?
Building entirely in the open with a public source code. Anyone can read and understand the complete design, propose modifications, create forks. Pull request as resume. With motivation and skills you can start from anywhere. Gatekeeping as answering questions. If people can't answer these sorts of questions, you shouldn't work with them. Giving the individual irrevocable power and new abilities to build worlds. Advancing this technology to allow creation of specialized ideal societies. Raising the bar for open source. Competitions selecting for ability and quickness. Contribution measured in quality of code. 

Bounties(Issues)
Choose a bounty(issue), solve it(pull request), and repeat. That’s it!

$$$
   $100 - a few hours of work for an experienced developer; a good intro for someone new
    $300 - a day of work for an experienced developer
    $500 - a few days of work for an experienced developer
    $1000 - a week or two of work (could be less for the right person)
    $1000+ bounties require planning and thought and likely a solid week+ of work. you probably should have done other bounties first. i'm happy to give feedback on serious proposals

Three step guide to getting a full time job (if you want one, you can do bounties / propose bounties for as long as you want)
1. Do bounties (for a couple weeks)
1.5. Promotion to "proposer." Propose your own bounties, have them approved, and do them (we pay obviously), show you can think as the company (for a couple weeks)
2. Intern
3. Full time
   

How to Start:

First search to see if the problem is already solved in the project
If not, open an issue describing the problem you want to solve
Use the Discord, Telegram, and or X/Twitter to coordinate and discuss development.
Once there is agreement that the problem should be solved, decide on the best solution
Create a branch to work on the solution
Make changes to files on the branch
Commit those changes
Open a pull request “requesting” that those changes be merged back into the “main” branch
Your colleagues review your pull request and either approve them or suggest changes
Once approved, your pull request is “merged” and your changes are now “live” on the main branch
Get paid
