# Example-Society-as-an-Open-Source-Project
Designing a society through an open source github project. Example with component files created from Notes on the Synthesis of Form by Christopher Alexander "The Determination of Components for an Indian Village" and issues created with information from Praxis. Direct words used from both. Open source and bounty approach inspired by @geohot George Hotz.

How to Use:

Open an issue describing the problem you want to solve
Once there is agreement that the problem should be solved, decide on the best solution
Create a branch to work on the solution
Make changes to files on the branch
Commit those changes
Open a pull request “requesting” that those changes be merged back into the “main” branch
Your colleagues review your pull request and either approve them or suggest changes
Once approved, your pull request is “merged” and your changes are now “live” on the main branch

On open source
Open source causes treating like own
Bounties with explicit requirements and help when far enough along
Pull request as resume, working hard and really contributing well, actually doing the job directly
$600 bounties
Employee spectrum. motivation and skills, can start from anywhere
Open source gets fixed, closed not worth tons of effort
Gatekeeping as answering questions. If people can't answer these sorts of questions, you shouldn't work with them and they shouldn't be in tech.
Empowering the individual, giving the individual irrevocable power and new abilities, not dependent on Industrial Society
Advancing this technology to allow return to nature
Raising the bar for open source
More open and modifiable win the space
Working on it in the open
Competitors and competitions selecting for ability and quickness. 
Contributors contributing value to open source projects.
Measuring in quality
Before you do work, you should be able to explain to a contractor what you want done.
Good solution to programming challenge in email
Microinternship, meet team, work on real problem in codebase for a few days
 Fork openpilot on GitHub. This is where all development happens and where you’ll push your code.
    Join the community Discord. Along with GitHub, this is where openpilot developers coordinate and discuss development.
    Set up your development environment. openpilot is designed to run on a smartphone processor, so any PC will do.
    Play the openpilot CTF to learn the tools.
Building entirely in public
Bounty system. little difference between an "internal" and "external"
Same tools
Blur line between contributor and employee. Spectrum from external to full time
Choose a bounty, solve it, and repeat. That’s it! No resume polishing or coding on a whiteboard. Once you’ve solved a few, reach out to givemeajob@comma.ai.
Rules

    code must be merged into openpilot master
    bounty eligibility is solely at our discretion
    once you open a PR, the bounty is locked to you until you stop working on it
    open a ticket at comma.ai/support with links to your PRs to claim
    get an extra 20% if you redeem your bounty in comma shop credit (including refunds on previous orders)

We put up each bounty with the intention that it'll get merged, but occasionally the right resolution is to close the bounty, which only becomes clear once some effort is put in. This is still valuable work, so we'll pay out $100 for getting any bounty closed with a good explanation.

   $100 - a few hours of work for an experienced openpilot developer; a good intro for someone new to openpilot
    $300 - a day of work for an experienced openpilot developer
    $500 - a few days of work for an experienced openpilot developer
    $1k+ - a week or two of work (could be less for the right person)

New bounties can be proposed in the #contributing channel in Discord.


See company goals on https://tinygrad.org
For bounty questions, join the Discord, but please read the question document first. http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

Three step guide to getting a full time job (if you want one, you can do bounties / propose bounties for as long as you want)
https://twitter.com/__tinygrad__/status/1732448088604950598
1. Do bounties (for a couple weeks)
1.5. Promotion to "proposer." Propose your own bounties, have them approved, and do them (we pay obviously), show you can think as the company (for a couple weeks)
2. Intern
3. Full time

$100 bounties are a few line change and could be 10 minutes if you see it
$200 bounties are a couple hours to a day of work and are mostly standalone
$500 bounties are a couple days of work and require a few prereqs
$1000 bounties require some refactoring to core tinygrad
$1000+ bounties require planning and thought and likely a solid week+ of work. you probably should have done other bounties first. i'm happy to give feedback on serious proposals
If you would like to sponsor a new bounty, e-mail george@tinygrad.org. Please include a clear description and a dollar amount.




WE NEED A SIMPLE MECHANISM THAT REVEALS THE LATENT ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL CAPITAL OF OUR COMMUNITY, AMPLIFIES EXISTING ZEAL, AND MAXIMIZES IT IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRAXIS. 

PRAX is a measure of a stakeholder's contribution to the development of Praxis, calculated on the basis of the quality of attempt and completion of specified actions target at furthering the project. The revealed economic and cultural captial will convey to capital markets the scale and quality of demand for PRaxis unlocking the scalable financial commitments needed to unlock rule changes from Host Governments

Proven demand unlocks capital; capital unlocks rule changes that accellerate tech progress

You earn PRAX by doing Commits. Commits are specified actions that contribute to dthe development of Praxis: the movement, the city, and (eventually) the network. Commits demonstrate and growt the economic and cultural capital of Praxis. 
You also earn PRAX by referring citizens and companies that apply to the Steel Visa and BOP. If successful, you earn PRAX

Initially, only stakeholders (Residents, BOPs, and applicants to both) are eligible. You can apply to become eligible.
