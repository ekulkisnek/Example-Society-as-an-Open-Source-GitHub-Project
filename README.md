# Example-Society-as-an-Open-Source-Project
Designing a society through an open source GitHub project. Example with component files created from Notes on the Synthesis of Form by Christopher Alexander "The Determination of Components for an Indian Village" and issues created with information from Praxis. Direct words used from both. Open source and bounty approach inspired by @geohot George Hotz.

Why an open source GitHub?
Building entirely in public. The more open and modifiable win. Open source gets fixed, closed not worth tons of effort. Pull request as resume, working hard and really contributing well, actually doing the job directly. With motivation and skills can start from anywhere. Gatekeeping as answering questions. If people can't answer these sorts of questions, you shouldn't work with them. Empowering the individual, giving the individual irrevocable power and new abilities, not dependent on Industrial Society. Advancing this technology to allow return to nature. Raising the bar for open source. Working on it in the open. Competitors and competitions selecting for ability and quickness. Contributors contributing value to open source projects. Measuring in quality. Before you do work, you should be able to explain to a contractor what you want done.


Bounties
Choose a bounty, solve it, and repeat. That’s it! No resume polishing or coding on a whiteboard. Once you’ve solved a few, reach out to x@x.org

Rules
    code must be merged into openpilot master
    bounty eligibility is solely at our discretion
    once you open a PR, the bounty is locked to you until you stop working on it
    open a ticket at comma.ai/support with links to your PRs to claim
    get an extra 20% if you redeem your bounty in credit

   $100 - a few hours of work for an experienced developer; a good intro for someone new
    $300 - a day of work for an experienced developer
    $500 - a few days of work for an experienced developer
    $1000 - a week or two of work (could be less for the right person)
    $1000+ bounties require planning and thought and likely a solid week+ of work. you probably should have done other bounties first. i'm happy to give feedback on serious proposals
If you would like to sponsor a new bounty, e-mail x@x.org Please include a clear description and a dollar amount.

See company goals on x.org

How to Start:

First search to see if the problem is already solved in the project
If not, open an issue describing the problem you want to solve
Use the Discord, Telegram, and or X/Twitter to coordinate and discuss development.
Once there is agreement that the problem should be solved, decide on the best solution
Create a branch to work on the solution
Make changes to files on the branch
Commit those changes
Open a pull request “requesting” that those changes be merged back into the “main” branch
Your colleagues review your pull request and either approve them or suggest changes
Once approved, your pull request is “merged” and your changes are now “live” on the main branch
Get paid
